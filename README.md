# Bumblebee-2.0---Self-Driving-Car-
This project is about automation of a car. With a given source and destination from a predefined
road map, the car will be able to ride from source to destination by itself. The car will operate in
two mood.
  1. Self driving mood
  2. Manual mood
  
In self driving mood it will ride itself through the road from source to destination. And in manual
mood the driver will drive it through the road. Here as a driver we will drive it with a remote like a
remote control car.
The main challenge will be implementing the self driving mood. Cause here the car needs to define
it roads and avoid obstacle itself and also it needs to control it’s speed. So some complex structure
and coding may be required.


## Features
### In Manual Mood:
  1. Speed can be controlled
  2. Direction can be changed
  3. If a obstacle found car will give signal
  4. Breaking system will be added
### Self Driving Mood:
  1. Car will control it’s speed
  2. Direction will be changed by itself
  3. Obstacle will be avoided
  4. Breaking will be done in necessary
  5. Path will be choose by itself
  
Eventually the car will reach from source to destination by itself from following a given map.


## Required Items
  0. Car
  1. Arduino
  2. Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection
  3. Arduino Servo Motor
  4. Battery
  5. Arduino Bluetooth Module
  6. Lots of wires
  7. Computer
